# UI Components and Design

## Overview
The Gym Management System features a modern JavaFX user interface with custom styling. The UI is divided into two main components: the login screen and the dashboard interface.

## Login Screen
The login interface is defined in [FXMLDocument.fxml](mdc:src/gymmanagementsystem/FXMLDocument.fxml) and styled with [loginDesign.css](mdc:src/gymmanagementsystem/loginDesign.css).

Key components:
- Username and password fields
- Login button
- Registration option
- Minimize and close buttons

The login functionality is controlled by [FXMLDocumentController.java](mdc:src/gymmanagementsystem/FXMLDocumentController.java).

## Dashboard
The main dashboard interface is defined in [dashboard.fxml](mdc:src/gymmanagementsystem/dashboard.fxml) and styled with [dashboardDesign.css](mdc:src/gymmanagementsystem/dashboardDesign.css).

The dashboard consists of:
1. A sidebar navigation menu
2. A main content area with multiple tabs/forms:
   - Dashboard overview (statistics)
   - Members management
   - Coaches management
   - Payment tracking

All dashboard functionality is controlled by [dashboardController.java](mdc:src/gymmanagementsystem/dashboardController.java).

### Member Management
- Member information form

## Styling Guidelines
The application uses custom CSS for styling UI components. Key styling aspects include:

1. **Color Scheme**:
   - Primary colors: Blue, white
   - Accent colors: Various shades of blue and gray
   - Status indicators: Green (active), red (inactive)

2. **Typography**:
   - Sans-serif fonts for modern appearance
   - Clear hierarchy with different sizes for headings, labels, and content

3. **Components**:
   - Custom styled buttons with hover effects
   - Modern form fields with validation styling
   - Clean, organized tables for data display
   - Card-like sections for content organization

4. **Responsiveness**:
   - Layouts designed to adapt to different window sizes
   - Scrollable areas for handling large data sets

## UI Navigation Flow
1. Application starts at the login screen
2. Upon successful authentication, the user is directed to the dashboard
3. The sidebar menu allows navigation between different sections
4. Each section maintains its state independently

## Custom Controls
The application uses JavaFX's built-in controls enhanced with custom styling, including:
- TableView for data tables
- TextField and PasswordField for input
- ComboBox for dropdown selections
- DatePicker for date selection
- Charts for data visualization
