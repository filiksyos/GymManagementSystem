Advanced Programming Course Project (25%)
Identify a real-world problem, such as a library management system, dormitory management
system, or any other domain that requires a software solution. Based on your selected problem,
develop a comprehensive software system while adhering to the following guidelines:
 UML Class Diagram: Design a UML class diagram to illustrate the structure of your
system.
 Authentication System: Implement a secure login interface that serves as an entry point
to access other system functionalities.
 User Interfaces: Develop at least eight distinct user interfaces to facilitate system
operations.
 Database Design: Create a relational database with a minimum of five tables, defining
their relationships appropriately.
 CRUD Operations: Ensure that the system supports essential database operations,
including Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionalities.
 Exception Handling: Integrate exception handling mechanisms to manage potential errors
effectively, applying the concepts learned in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
 Operational Documentation: Prepare an operational document detailing the system’s
functionalities and operation. This document should include:
o The title of the project you have selected
o List of group members with their ID Number
o A description of the system’s core features and workflow.
o UML class diagrams and database table’s relationship design.
NB: As the system incorporates enhanced functionalities and attractive design, your result will be
determined accordingly. The more you do, the better you get.
